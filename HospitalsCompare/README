The data for this assignment come from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov)
run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data 
and information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. This 
dataset essentially covers all major U.S. hospitals. This dataset is used for a variety of purposes, 
including determining whether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality care to patients 
(see http://goo.gl/jAXFX for some background on this particular topic).
The Hospital Compare web site contains a lot of data and we will only look at a small subset for this
assignmenti, specifically these three files
   • outcome-of-care-measures.csv: Contains information about 30-day mortality and readmission rates
     for heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia for over 4,000 hospitals.
   • hospital-data.csv: Contains information about each hospital.
   • Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf: Descriptions of the variables in each file (i.e the code book).
